# Topacio Trade: A Powerful Tool for Traders
The Topacio Trade project is a tool designed to support traders, investors, and people interested in the world of cryptocurrencies in making informed decisions in various market volatility scenarios.

How can we identify the best price to open a position in the cryptocurrency market? How can we avoid falling into price manipulation traps set by those who move the market? These are some of the questions we asked ourselves before starting the development of Topacio Trade.

Our team of experts has carried out several studies, analyses, and tests to gather coherent information that has been applied to an effective analysis in various market scenarios, resulting in the creation of Topacio Trade.

This tool is designed to operate in extreme market conditions, analyzing and selecting the best times to buy and sell cryptocurrencies in the spot and futures markets, thus avoiding market ranges. With an efficiency of 90% in different operational timeframes, Topacio Trade performs automated buying and selling based on the user's set configuration, according to their trading plans and investment preferences.

However, Topacio Trade is not just a powerful and effective tool; it also offers an interactive user experience and has its own governance token called "TOPACIO" and a rewards token named "TMINE". Users can also access an ecosystem that integrates the entire Web3 world and features a unique NFT that provides utility for using the automated system. These NFTs can be bought and sold in an independent marketplace module, or they can be staked to receive the TMINE token as a reward, empowering users and providing real-world functionality.

# Unique Features of the Topacio Project
The features of Topacio Trade are unique and disruptive, offering a fully functional tool that runs on the Polygon blockchain. This Layer 2 network enables decentralized applications to operate on a fast, interoperable network with lower fees compared to Ethereum. Users can access the Topacio Trading ecosystem using their Polygon mainnet wallet address, which is also used to store the NFT fragments necessary to assemble a complete TOPACIO NFT.

By owning these NFTs, users can access different trading functionalities, automating their operations in both the spot and futures markets. The platform offers the option to buy and/or sell automatically at absolute market breakout points, taking advantage of trending movements. Additionally, Topacio Trading features a healthy economy and a crafting module that allows users to forge authentic gems and destroy NFTs via crafting, resulting in an upgraded asset, thereby creating a constant burn mechanism and a healthy economy within the platform.

# What Are NFT Gem Fragments?
The Genesis generation of fragments is the initial collection, represented by 24 varieties of common gem fragments. These are collectible, and all initial holders who manage to gather 8 fragments of any variety will be able to craft (fuse) an epic NFT upon release. This epic NFT offers better returns than common ones, and these epics, when fused in sets of 8, will give birth to a complete, fully functional Topacio NFT. Each epic fragment that a user "fuses" represents one of the faces of the Topacio logo, and when crafting the Topacio NFT, those 8 fragments are burned. Topacio NFTs are unique, as they can vary in rarity and have different attributes, increasing their scarcity, exclusivity, and usability.

# Subscriptions
Subscriptions provide 31 days of access to the Topacio ecosystem. Additionally, you can join the exclusive community's private Telegram channel and have access to the bot notification channel to keep up with market movements and the best opportunities it provides for trading.

For each subscription, the user receives a ticket hosted on the blockchain. Once a user collects 3 tickets, they can exchange them for gem fragments, which can be used to create a complete Topacio Gem, and they can also redeem additional rewards from event vaults.

# Tokenomics and Future Plans

</div>

The Topacio ecosystem will feature a native governance token (TOPACIO) that will have 100% integrated use throughout its ecosystem, with real-world functionality. When a Topacio NFT holder wants to set up automations according to their preferences and strategies, they will do so as a transaction on the Polygon blockchain. This transaction will be signed from their decentralized Web3 wallet, with a small fee paid in the TOPACIO governance token.

Distribution and Governance Token

The entire Topacio ecosystem will follow the distribution below, governed by a 100% functional governance token with real utility. In some cases, it will provide returns within its DeFi ecosystem through Staking (Block and Flexible).
